# Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform

For years, I've been keeping up with more than 200 cyber security feeds. Thanks to Feedly, I am supported by an AI that helps me filter the important posts. Thanks to DeepL all english news are translated into German to support the local community.

Important content is shared with my network on Twitter and via Microsoft Teams, and also published on a website with RSS feed.
