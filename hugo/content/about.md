# Open-source-intelligence aggregator

![News Item Processing Flow](/images/simplifiedspecification.png)


- Cybersecurity trends
- Breaking news
- Malware, ransomware, bots
- Vulnerabilities, CVEs and, exploits
- Threat actor groups, APTs...

Cybersecurity is a game of foresight and preparation. It is a cat and mouse game where defenders need to outsmart hackers by reacting quickly to current trends.


## Protection

Information gathering is tedious due to the diversity of available sources: thousands of new articles and, posts and tweets need to be reviewed and triaged every day. Finding critical threats in that float of noise can be time-consuming and overwhelming.

That is why our cybersecurity experts continuously analyze more than *250 hand-picked sources* and detect trends using static methods. This aggregator was launched for collaboratively research, share knowledge and ultimately protect companies, like yours.

## Cut the information overload without missing out
Artificial intelligence and such as the Research Assistant [Leo](https://blog.feedly.com/leo/), natural language processing (NLP), and user behaviors of [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) users are applied to statistical models to preselect content. In the initial phase, all entries are checked by human beings to fine-tune the models and to ensure relevance. All text extracts are manually picked to capture the most relevant information. 

## News in your native language
The world speaks many languages, just as we. We leverage [deep learning](https://www.deepl.com/home) innovations to present the content in English and German. Thanks to machine learning, almost no grammatical mistakes occur. If you miss your mother tongue, contact us and we will include it. The following languages are available: Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Japanese, and Chinese.

## Continuous learning
Our site and models are continuously being optimized and we would be pleased to support your research. Our archive has more than 750.000 articles and posts on cyber. Feel free to contact us if you need information about CVE/CVSS/Exploit information. We intend to make our archive searchable in the future so that trends, such as cyber attacks, can be easily identified.
